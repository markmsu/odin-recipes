        <h3> Ingredients </h3>
        <p>The ingredients for macaroni and cheese are: 8 ounces of uncooked elbow macaroni, ¼ cup of salted butter, 3 tablespoons of all-purpose flour, 2 ½ cups of milk (or more as needed), 2 cups of shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, ½ cup of finely grated Parmesan cheese, and salt and ground black pepper to taste (optional).</p>

        <h3> Steps </h3>
        <p>To prepare macaroni and cheese, follow these steps: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and grease an 8-inch square baking dish. First, make the macaroni by bringing a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the macaroni and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; it will finish cooking in the oven. Drain and transfer the macaroni to the prepared baking dish. While the macaroni is cooking, melt ¼ cup of butter in a medium skillet over low heat. Whisk in the flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, about 3 to 5 minutes. Gradually whisk 2 ½ cups of milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a simmer. Stir in the shredded Cheddar and finely grated Parmesan cheeses; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir over low heat until the cheese is melted and the sauce has thickened, about 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to ½ cup more milk if needed. Pour the cheese sauce over the macaroni and stir until well combined. To make the bread crumb topping, melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the bread crumbs and cook, stirring, until well coated and browned. Spread the bread crumbs over the macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle with paprika. Bake in the preheated oven until the topping is golden brown and the macaroni and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes.</p>
